# This is my first Python code.
# Start Date: 18 September 2024
#Contains: (Print, Variables, Arithmetic)

# 1.PRINT
print("I love pizza")
print("It's really good")



# 2.VARIABLES
full_name = "Joe George"
age = "18"
is_student = True

print(f"Hello {full_name}!")
print(f"Your name is {full_name} and you are {age} years old.")
print(f"Are you a student? Ans: {is_student}")

if is_student:
    print("He is a student")
else:
    print("He is not a student")



# 3.ARITHMETIC
#Addition
friends = 5              #now printing friends =5

friends +=5              #now printing friends= 5+5 =10
                         #another way is (friends = friends + 5)
print(friends)

#Subtraction
enemies = 10

enemies -= 5      #now printing enemies= 10-5 =5
                         #another way is (enemies = enemies - 5)
print(enemies)

#Multiplication
allies = 10

allies *= 2              #now printing allies= 5*2 =10
                         #another way is (allies = allies*2)
print(allies)

#Division
foes = 10

foes /= 2                #now printing foes= 10/2 =5
                         #another way is (foes = foes / 2)
print(foes)

#Integer Division
# (Same shit as division but it rounds off to the nearest integer)
rivals = 10

rivals //= 3             #now printing rivals =10/3 â‰ˆ3
                         #another way is (rivals = rivals//3)
print(rivals)

#Remainder
guys = 10

guys %= 3                #now printing guys = 10/3 remainder=1
                         #another way is (guys = guys%3)
print(guys)
